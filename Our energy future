Why do we use liquid fuels?

Liquid fuels have become the energy carriers for the transportation sector due to ther high volumetric and specific energy properties.

But not all. Hydrogen has the highest energy density, on a per mass basis, but hydrogen has a low energy density, on a per volume basis.

Fossil fuels are energy sources that come from the remains of plants and animals. It takes millions of years to form. According to the EPA, 86 percent of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. There are three fossil fuels: oil, natural gas and coal. Coal is the most abundant and the least expensive. Fossil fuels have two major problems. (1) They are non-renewable energy sources. Over time have been exhausted. (2) The burning of fossil fuels has adverse effects on human health and the environment. These factors have inspired research into alternative forms of energy.

we all know the impact of using fossil fuels, but how much?
